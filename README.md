Bootstrap vs Tailwindcss >>>
Bootstrap:
Component-based: Bootstrap is a component-based framework, meaning it provides a set of predefined UI components such as buttons, cards, navbars, etc., which you can use to quickly build your website or web application.
Class-based: Bootstrap uses pre-defined CSS classes to style components. You add these classes to your HTML elements to apply the desired styles.
Opinionated: Bootstrap has a more opinionated design compared to Tailwind CSS. It comes with its own design philosophy and default styles, which can be customized to some extent.
Requires Less Configuration: Bootstrap requires less configuration and setup compared to Tailwind CSS. It's easier to get started with Bootstrap, especially for beginners.

Tailwind CSS:
Utility-first: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of providing pre-designed components, it offers low-level utility classes that you can use to style your HTML directly. For example, classes like text-center, bg-blue-500, etc.
Class-based: Similar to Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS is class-based. You use utility classes directly in your HTML to style elements.
Highly Customizable: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable and allows for greater flexibility in terms of design. You can easily create custom designs by composing utility classes.
Larger Learning Curve: Tailwind CSS has a steeper learning curve compared to Bootstrap, especially for developers who are not familiar with utility-first CSS frameworks.
Reduced Bundle Size: Tailwind CSS allows you to create smaller bundle sizes by only including the utility classes that you use, resulting in optimized CSS output for your project.
